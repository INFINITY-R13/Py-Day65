**Color theory** in **web design** is a fundamental set of principles and guidelines for creating harmonious and effective color combinations. Using color strategically can significantly impact user experience by conveying meaning, evoking emotions, guiding navigation, and reinforcing **brand identity**.

### Key Elements of Color Theory in Web Design

* **The Color Wheel:** This tool visually represents colors and their relationships. It is the basis for creating various color schemes:
    * **Primary Colors:** Red, Yellow, and Blue (traditional) or Red, Green, and Blue (**RGB** model, used for digital displays).
    * **Secondary Colors:** Created by mixing two primary colors (e.g., Orange, Green, Purple).
    * **Tertiary Colors:** Created by mixing a primary and a secondary color (e.g., Yellow-Green).
* **Color Harmonies (Color Schemes):** These are combinations of colors that are visually appealing and balanced:
    * **Monochromatic:** Uses various tints, shades, and saturation of a single color. It's cohesive but can be monotonous.
    * **Analogous:** Uses colors located next to each other on the color wheel. This creates a unified and serene look.
    * **Complementary:** Uses two colors directly opposite each other (e.g., red and green). This creates high contrast and visual excitement, often used for **Call to Action (CTA)** buttons to make them stand out.
    * **Triadic:** Uses three colors evenly spaced around the color wheel. This is vibrant and dynamic while maintaining harmony.
* **Color Attributes:**
    * **Hue:** The purest form of a color (e.g., red, blue).
    * **Saturation (Intensity):** How rich or vivid a color is. High saturation is vibrant; low is muted.
    * **Lightness (Value/Brightness):** How light or dark a color is. **Tints** are created by adding white; **Shades** by adding black.
* **Color Warmth:**
    * **Warm Colors:** Red, orange, and yellow; associated with energy, passion, and excitement.
    * **Cool Colors:** Blue, green, and purple; associated with calmness, trust, and serenity.
* **Color Psychology:** Colors evoke specific emotions and associations (e.g., blue suggests **trust** and **calmness**, often seen on corporate sites; red suggests **urgency** or **excitement**). This should align with the brand's message and target audience.
* **Contrast and Accessibility:** High contrast between text and background is crucial for **readability** and **accessibility** (WCAG guidelines). It helps users differentiate elements and is vital for users with low vision or color blindness. For digital design, the **HEX** and **RGB** color systems are standard.
